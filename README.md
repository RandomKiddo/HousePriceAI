### Goal

As part of a club project starting in August 2022, we sought to collaborate to create a model that predicts house prices in a certain area based on many factors like square feet, amount of bedrooms, and more. Using knowledge we gained from said club meetings and our own personal programming skills, we were able to create a highly accurate and successful model given the data set. All acknowledged libraries and sources are located in the Jupyter Notebook file, however, we would still like to credit the original dataset at: [Kaggle - House Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata).

Additionally, we would like to thank all officers of AI Club: Fall 2022 for supporting us in this journey with their helpful workshops.

#### Business understanding - What does the business need?

The realastate business that needs to set house prices would need a way to automatically determine the prices of a house based on certain characteristics.
